A minimal set of geopolitical and geophysical terms are included as required for financial risk management and other application use cases, and these are all to be considered as placeholders for suitable standard ontologies for these concepts as these become available. These terms may also be mapped to controlled vocabulary standards such as ISO 3166." ;

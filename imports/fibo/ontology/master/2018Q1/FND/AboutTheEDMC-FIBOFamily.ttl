	sm:familyAbstract """The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) is a collaborative effort among industry practitioners, semantic technology experts and information scientists to standardize the language used to precisely define the terms, conditions, and characteristics of financial instruments; the legal and relationship structure of business entities; the content and time dimensions of market data; and the legal obligations and process aspects of corporate actions.  The definitions and relationships that comprise the FIBO family of specifications have been modularized into a number of specifications, which in turn include a number of modules, each of which is further modularized into one or more constituent ontologies. These specifications are, or will be, standards published by the Object Management Group. 

The FIBO ontologies are available as OWL 2 ontologies from the OMG site, and as UML models that are compliant with the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM), in the form of UML XMI and ODM XMI and are linked by specification and version at https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/.""" ;
